# Integrate an Azure Machine Learning endpoint in your PowerApp

### Why?

In this tutorial, you will use PowerApps and PowerAutomate to quickly create an app that is using a model deployed on ACI with Azure Machine Learning.

### Contents
This tutorial only covers how to integrate your already deployed model in PowerApps and PowerAutomate. The tutorial is based on a model that has been created and deployed in the DP-100: Designing and Implementing Data Science Solutions on Microsoft Azure course. Find the DP-100 instructions [here](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/DP100/tree/master/labdocs). 

If you haven't participated in the full DP-100 course, these are the labs you need to complete before you can do this tutorial:
- Lab 1A
- Lab 1B: Task 1 only (installing SDK and cloning Git Repo)
- Lab 7A
